Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Time: 4 hours

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil

9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
6. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts.
9. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok.
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2. Mix in 1/2 cup warm water, flour, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vegetable oil.
13. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked.
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon salt

5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.
